## Motivation for this project:
Building a simple chatting application, that went through four stages of development,

#### stage 1: server client
here both ends of a network were both chatting parties.

#### stage 2: server takes the role of a medium only
here the server acts as a proper server and only transmits messages to users via direction

#### stage 3: 2 server setup
here a second server was added and data needed to be relayed from a server to the other as well as in each server's local network

#### stage 4: 4 server setup
here 4 servers needed to cooperate to find unique usernames for the users, as well as direct chat messages to the intended target through the whole network
